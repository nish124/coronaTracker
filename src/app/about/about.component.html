    <p class="question">Are you official?</p>
    <p class="answer">No.</p>
    <p class="question">What are your sources? How is the data gathered for this project?</p>
    <p class="answer">We are using state bulletins and official handles to update our numbers. The data is validated by a group of volunteers and published into a Google sheet and an API. API is available for all at api.covid19india.org. We would love it if you can use this data in the fight against this virus. The source list is here.</p>
    <p class="question">What are "Unassigned" cases? Why are they so high? Why aren't their recovery details captured</p>
    <p class="answer">This is a category maintained by MOHFW as "Cases being reassigned to states". We are unsure the exact reason why this category is kept by MOHFW. We belive that number of cases in this category is reduced when old cases are assigned to state - but we're not sure. Since MOHFW doesn't give any information regarding how many cases are reassigned to which state, we can only speculate that any decrease in the number of cases in this category is reflected as equal increase in cases in multiple state. For more information, please reach out to MOHFW directly.</p>
    <p class="question">Where can I find the data for this?</p>
    <p class="answer">All the data is available through an API for further analysis and development here : api.covid19india.org</p>
    <p class="question">Who are you?</p>
    <p class="answer">We are a group of dedicated volunteers who curate and verify the data coming from several sources. We extract the details, like a patient's relationship with other patients to identify local and community transmissions, travel history and status. We never collect or expose any personally identifiable data regarding the patients.</p>
    <p class="question">Why are you guys putting in time and resources to do this while not gaining a single penny from it?</p>
    <p class="answer">Because it affects all of us. Today it's someone else who is getting infected; tomorrow it could be us. We need to prevent the spread of this virus. We need to document the data so that people with knowledge can use this data to make informed decisions.</p>
